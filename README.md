 Implementation of MIPS-32 RISC Processor using Verilog 
 
∗ The Processor is structured with a five-stage Pipelined architecture known as the Instruction Fetch (IF),
Instruction Decode(ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write-Back (WB) stages.
∗ Implemented various addressing modes including Direct Register Addressing(RR),Register Immediate Ad-
dressing(RM), Base Addressing and Relative addressing Integrated with several ALU functions
